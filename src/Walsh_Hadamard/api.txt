The API of the Walsh-Hadamard pattern matching utility
======================================================

Introduction
------------
This utility performs fast pattern matching using projection on
Walsh-Hadamard kernels.

The inputs are a source image (of any size) and a pattern image. The pattern
must be square with an edge of 2^n, up to a size of 128x128 (note that
sizes of more than 32x32 require changing some compilation flags in wh.h).

The output is a list of matches, where each match contains information on the
location of the match in the source image and the euclidean distance of
the match from the pattern.


Installation:
-------------
Just put the .c & .h files in the same folder and compile - there is no need
for any special makefile. Since running time is important here, it is
recommended to compile with the maximum speed flag.

Windows users can use the supplied static library WHPatternMatching.lib,
instead of compiling the source code themselves.

This package doesn't include any libraries for loading, saving & displaying
images. Since image data is needed as input, the user should provide his own
image libraries.


Process outline:
----------------

 1) Create a WHSetup, defining the sizes of the source image and the pattern,
    and the required amount of WH kernels to project the image on.

 2) Create Image structs that will hold the source & pattern images.

 3) Notify the WHSetup on the desired source and pattern images.

 4) Perform the pattern matching on the WHSetup with the desired threshold.

 5) Retrieve the results from the WHSetup.

 6) To perform another pattern matching with a different threshold, go back
    to step 4.
	To perform another pattern matching with different source or pattern
	images of the same size as declared in the setup creation, go back to
	step 2 (only the new image/pattern needs to be created and notified this
	time). 
	To perform another pattern matching with different source or pattern
	images of a different size than the size that was declared in the setup
	creation, go back to step 1.

 7) When finished, destroy all the WHSetups that were created.


Setup creation:
---------------
WalshSetup * createWalshSetup(coordT sourceRows, coordT sourceCols,
							  coordT patternRows, basisT numOfBasis)

Creates and returns a WHSetup that supports source matrices of size
(sourceRows,sourceCols), patterns of size (patternRows, patternRows) and
the given number of WH kernels to be used for projection.


Image creation:
---------------
Image *createImage(pixelT *pixels, coordT rows, coordT cols)

Creates and returns an Image of the given size, with the given pixels array.
Each pixel is an 8-bit gray level value, and the array should be in rows
order, i.e. the top row from left to right, then the second row from left to
right, etc.


Specifying a source image:
--------------------------
void setSourceImage(WHSetup *setup, Image *source)

Notifies the setup on the given source image. The image must be of the size
that was declared in the creation of the setup. As long as the source image
is of the declared size, there is no need to create new setups, and the same
setup can be used for many source images.


Specifying a pattern image:
--------------------------
void setPatternImage(WHSetup *setup, Image *pattern)

Notifies the setup on the given pattern image. The pattern must be of the size
that was declared in the creation of the setup. As with the source image, as
long as the pattern image is of the declared size, there is no need to create
new setups, and the same setup can be used for many patterns.


Pattern Matching:
-----------------
void whPatternMatch(WHSetup *setup, distanceT rejectThresh)

Performs pattern matching on the given setup. The given rejectThresh specifies
the maximum mean difference (in pixels) between the pattern and a match. After
the execution of this function, the resulting matches list and the number of
matches that were found are available in the setup.
The pattern matching process is done using three methods, in this order:
Top Down - the whole image is projected on the WH kernels, starting with
           the lowest frequency kernel. Each such projection rejects some
           of the suspected windows. After each projection, the percentage
           of remaining suspected windows is measured.
Bottom Up - when the percentage of suspected windows goes under a certain
            margin, the Top Down method is replaced by Bottom Up. In this
            method, only the remaining suspected windows are projected,
            instead of the whole image. Here as well, each projection
            rejects some more suspected windows, reducing the percentage
 		    of remaining windows. The percentage margin for moving to
            Bottom Up is initially 10%, and it can be changed using the
            setMethodStartPercent() function.
Direct Distance - when the percentage of suspected windows goes under
                  a second margin, the Bottom Up method is replaced by
                  Direct Distance. In this method, the Eculidean distance
                  between each of the remaining suspected windows and the
                  pattern is computed, enabling the final rejection of
                  all the windows with distance above the threshold. The
			      percentage margin for moving to Direct Distance is
			      initially 2%, and it can be changed using the
                  setMethodStartPercent() function.


Specifying the pattern matching method percentage:
--------------------------------------------------
void setMethodStartPercent(WHSetup *setup, float bottomUpStartPercent,
						   float distanceStartPercent)

Notifies the setup on the percentage that should be used for determining the
switching between the pattern matching methods. When the percentage of
suspected windows goes below bottomUpStartPercent, the method changes from
Top Down to Bottom Up. When the percentage of suspected windows goes below
distanceStartPercent, the method changes from Bottom Up to Direct Distance.
The default values of bottomUpStartPercent & distanceStartPercent are 10% and
2% respectively. This function should be called only if the user wants to
changes these default values. such a change may be done in order to optimize
the running time of the pattern matching process on different computation
platforms.


Retrieving the number of matches:
---------------------------------
int numOfMatches(WHSetup *setup)

Returns the number of matches that were found in the last pattern matching.


Retrieving the matches list:
----------------------------
Match * matches(WHSetup *setup)

Returns the array of Matches that were found in the last pattern matching.
Each Match contains the location of the match in the source image and the
Euclidean distance of the match from the pattern. The following macros can be
used to access the Match:
    matchY(Match *match), matchX(Match *match), matchDistance(Match *match).


Destroying a setup:
-------------------
void destroyWHSetup(WHSetup *setup)

Destroys the given WHSetup. Should be performed when no more pattern matching
is required on this setup.


Pattern Matching code Example:
------------------------------

Assume the contents of the following variables:
  pixelT *sourcePixels  - the source image data (in rows order)
  coordT sourceRows     - the number of rows in the source image
  coordT sourceCols     - the number of columns in the source image
  pixelT *patternPixels - the pattern image data (in rows order)
  coordT patternRows    - the number of rows in the pattern image

The following program searches for the pattern in the source image
with a threshold of 10 pixels, and prints the results. Up to 50
Walsh-Hadamard kernels will be used for projections:

  WalshSetup *setup = createWalshSetup(sourceRows, sourceCols, patternRows, 50);

  Image *source = createImage(sourcePixels, sourceRows, sourceCols);
  Image *pattern = createImage(patternPixels, patternRows, patternRows);

  Match *match;
  int count;

  setSourceImage(setup, source);
  setPatternImage(setup, pattern);

  whPatternMatch(setup, 10);		

  count = numOfMatches(setup);
  match = matches(setup);

  printf("%d matches were found:\n", count);

  while (count--) {
      printf("y=%d x=%d distance=%d\n", matchY(match), matchX(match),
 	         matchDistance(match));
      match++;
  }

  destroyWalshSetup(setup);

  destroyImage(source);
  destroyImage(pattern);
